## 🛠️ Hands-on Practice Summary (via AWS Console)

| AWS Service | What I Did |
|-------------|------------|
| **IAM**     | Created users, groups, and custom policies. Tested MFA and least-privilege access. |

## 📎 Notes

This repository is focused on **documenting practical knowledge** gained via AWS Console based on the SimuLearn course. No code was used — the objective was to reinforce architecture and cloud principles through real interactions with AWS services.

Future updates will include projects using **Terraform**, **CloudFormation**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.
